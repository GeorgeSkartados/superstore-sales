# 📊 Superstore Sales Dashboard (Excel Project)

## 💼 Overview

This Excel dashboard was created as a personal learning project to practice real-world data analysis from start to finish. I worked with fictional sales data from a Superstore company and took it through the full process: cleaning the raw data, creating new fields for grouping and segmentation, and then using PivotTables and slicers to build a one-page, interactive dashboard.

The goal was to simulate the kind of work a junior data analyst might be asked to do in a real business setting — like tracking monthly performance, comparing sales across regions, and identifying high-value customers. Everything was built in Excel Online, which meant working around certain limitations, but it helped reinforce the fundamentals of structure, logic, and storytelling with data.

In a real-world scenario, this type of dashboard could help sales or marketing teams quickly spot trends, focus on underperforming regions, or target specific customer segments for campaigns — all without needing code or external tools.
